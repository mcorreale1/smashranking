# smashranking
A project to create a power ranking for my schools smash club

# Challonge API Key
For now, expects a file called api.txt where it pulls the first line, which should be your API key from challonge,
where your tournaments should be hosted for this to work. 

# Folders
Everything where the data is stored (everything is saved into JSON format for now) will be located in the ./tourn directory
where a folder based on the game will be created with info for every tournament youve hosted, included all matches, and participants.
